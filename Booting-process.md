The booting process is the sequence of steps a computer follows to start up and load its operating system (OS) after being powered on. It involves the following stages:

1. **Power-On Self-Test (POST):** When the computer is powered on, the hardware performs a self-check to ensure everything is functioning correctly (e.g., memory, processor, and storage devices).
2. **Loading the Bootloader:** The BIOS (Basic Input/output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) firmware is activated, and it locates the bootloader, which is stored on the hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD).
3. **Bootloader Execution:** The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system into the computerâ€™s memory (RAM).
4. **Kernel Initialization:** The OS kernel (core part of the OS) is loaded into memory, and it begins initializing system resources like hardware drivers and system processes.
5. **System Services and User Interface:** The operating system loads system services, drivers, and the graphical user interface (GUI), allowing the user to interact with the system.

Once these steps are completed, the computer is ready for use.
